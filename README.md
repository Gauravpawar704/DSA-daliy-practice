# 📘 C++ DSA Learning Journey

This repository contains my **day-wise learning of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++**.  
I am a beginner and this repository represents my **daily practice, mistakes, corrections, and progress** while building strong programming fundamentals.

This journey is focused on **logic building, problem-solving, and understanding how things work internally**, not just writing code.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- Build a strong **DSA foundation**
- Improve **logical thinking**
- Prepare for **backend development in future**
- Practice **writing code daily**
- Maintain consistency using **GitHub**

---

## 🛠 Language Used
- **C++**

---

## 📅 Day-Wise Learning Summary

### ✅ Day 1 – Arrays (Foundation)
- What is an array
- Storing elements in contiguous memory
- Traversing array using loops
- Sum and average of elements
- Find maximum and minimum element
- Count even and odd numbers
- Linear search
- Frequency of elements

📌 *Learned how loops and indexes work together in arrays.*

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Sorting (Logic Building)
- Introduction to sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Why `n-1` is used in loop conditions
- Comparison of adjacent elements
- Understanding how largest element moves to the end
- Basic optimization idea

📌 *Improved loop logic and understanding of comparisons.*

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Stack (DSA Core)
- What is Stack
- LIFO (Last In First Out)
- Stack implementation using array
- Push operation
- Pop operation
- Stack overflow
- Stack underflow
- Role of `top` variable

📌 *Understood how stack works internally and how memory is managed.*

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Stack Practice (Deep Understanding)
- Menu-driven stack program
- Push, Pop, Display operations
- Why `top` is global
- Why `do-while` loop is used
- Handling overflow and underflow properly
- Debugging logic mistakes

📌 *Gained confidence by identifying and fixing errors myself.*

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Queue (DSA Core)
- What is Queue
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- Difference between Stack and Queue
- Enqueue operation
- Dequeue operation
- Front and Rear pointers
- Queue overflow and underflow
- Menu-driven queue program

📌 *Learned how queues are used in real-life systems like ticket counters and printers.*

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Arrays and indexing
- Loop conditions
- Stack operations and logic
- Queue operations and logic
- Overflow and underflow conditions
- Menu-driven programs
- Debugging and logical thinking

---

## 📌 Learning Approach
- Writing code **myself**, not copy-paste
- Understanding **why errors happen**
- Fixing mistakes logically
- Learning step-by-step without rushing
- Focusing on **clarity over speed**

---

## 🚀 Future Plan
- Continue DSA with:
  - Circular Queue
  - Linked List
  - Searching & Sorting
  - Recursion
- Later move to **Backend Development**
- Build real-world projects
